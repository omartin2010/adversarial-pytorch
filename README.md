# adversarial-pytorch
Pytorch implementation of an adversarial CNN example (Based on https://www.anishathalye.com/2017/07/25/synthesizing-adversarial-examples/). I can't take credit for it :), but I've gave it a shot at creating one version of it on Pytorch on a Windows, GPU enabled machine. The code should work on Linux too, as is. Perhaps change some // for \ in the code (for path references).

There might also be missing files here, pictures of me. But there's a cat.jpg file that works equally well.

Right now, I'm hitting an issue where the destination image is a bit too modified and you can see brightly colored dots. I'm not sure I fully understand why but I'm working on it.

Enjoy!
